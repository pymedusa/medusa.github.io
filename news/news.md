## 0.1.10

New year, new release! This time we are proud to bring you a very polished release, containing mainly bug fixes and some fine
tuning to our new indexers [TVmaze](http://www.tvmaze.com/) and [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/). A big part of the code that
powers the shows information has been rewritten. Adding and updating shows should now be faster than ever before. Some fixes were 
added to our [guessit](https://github.com/guessit-io/guessit) parser that will make the parsing of anime shows more reliable. Furthermore, the post-processing logic was improved. Processing epsiodes should be quicker and we also added some more detailed logs, that will help you understand what is going on exactly during the post-processing. Last but not least, we updated the main shows page, making it more visually appealing - more of this in the next release. As always, many bug fixes for our providers and indexers, including some old bug reports. We hope you enjoy this release. Make sure to report the bugs you find to our [Github issues tracker](https://github.com/pymedusa/Medusa/issues).

As for the users who are interested into new developments, we're working on a new feature for our Transmission torrent users.
We've added a new feature that removes the torrent from the torrent client, when the ratio (configured per provider) has been reached. You'll find this setting in the "Search settings" menu, as an opt-in setting. For now it will only log the removal but will not remove the torrent.
If your willing to help us out, please enable the setting and let us know if you notice a torrent removal is being logged when it shouldn't. We've started the implementation for the Transmission client. If this proves to be a useful addition, and no blocking issues pop up, we're planning to change the log to an actual removal and we'll also implement it for the other torrent clients.

## 0.1.9

After over a month of hard work, we are proud to bring you one more present for your Christmas tree! We promised it and here
it is: indexer support for [TVmaze](http://www.tvmaze.com/) and [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/). You can now choose your
favorite indexer, making sure you will never have to deal with missing shows or unreachable indexers again. As always we have
also fixed many bugs and cleaned up a lot of code. Make sure to check the [full changelog](https://github.com/pymedusa/Medusa/compare/master...develop) (almost 400 commits!) for more details. We'd like to take this
opportunity to wish everyone a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.

## 0.1.8.1

This is just a bug fix release in order to bring you more stability.
TVDB website was down for a few hours and that has caused issues that are now handled gracefully.
Remember that reporting issues helps us making a better software.

## 0.1.8

Once again, it's that time of the month! We are pleased to announce the release of our latest effort.
This release took some more time than usual, but for good reason. First of all, we finally have the new TvDB API up and running.
It includes many improvements, like season specific updates, and we can make sure to have a future-proof implementation. We have also added a new library called [knowit](https://github.com/ratoaq2/knowit), that will allow to obtain very detailed information about the files in our library, like video quality and audio format for example. These information will be extremely helpful in the future, as we are planning to extend the search possibilites. At the same time we are making progress with the Vue.js implementation, we don't have an ETA for the new user interface yet, but once [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) is added, it will be much easier to give Medusa a whole new look. Want something to look forward to in the near future? Support for [TVmaze](http://www.tvmaze.com/) and [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/) indexers is finally coming in our next major release! Like always, tons of tuning and bug fixes in this release as well. Make sure to check out the changelog for more detailed information.

## 0.1.7

Again, some more fixes and a lot of code improvements!

As promised we renamed the github repository from SickRage to Medusa. It's a transparent change, which shouldn't cause any trouble for the users. GitHub takes care of the redirect fortunately, so everything should be going smooth.
A lot of time and effort has been put into optimizing the post-processing process. That code has been partially rewritten and should be faster, more precise and a lot less error-prone now. 
Furthermore, as planned, we now have the "Manual Subtitle search" (CC icon) and the new "Subtitle re-download" (lang flag icon), which will allow you to re-download the subtitles whenever you'd like to. Please try it and give us some feedback!

<br/>

####2016-10-05####

## 0.1.6

Again some more fixes, a lot of code improvements!

We are planning to rename github repository from SickRage to Medusa. It will be transparent to users as Github does the redirect.

For 0.1.7 we are planning to release a new feature "Manual Subtitle search"! If you are brave enough contact us to help test and give feedback.

## 0.1.5.2 bugfix release

This is just another bugfix release.

<br/>

####2016-09-18####

## 0.1.5.1 bugfix release

This is just a bugfix release that will allow users to upgrade with other databases. Thanks to all bug reports that allowed us to handle this fairly quickly and sorry for the inconvenience. In the future, we will make sure this doesn't happen again.

## 0.1.5 here!

This week we are proud to bring you another important release, which focuses mainly on fixing annoying bugs and general code improvements. We worked hard to improve the History page, making it load noticeably faster than ever before. The page also contains proper information now, which should make it easier to distinguish between release types. The whole code behind proper detection and handling got improved as well. We've implemented a check that should prevent propering of different codecs, which was quite annoying. In addition to fixing and improving many providers, we now have an automatic bypass for the CloudFlare protection, which was preventing Medusa to scrape some of them. Last but not least: did you know that we have an extremely easy to use Windows installer now? Check it out [here](https://github.com/pymedusa/MedusaInstaller/releases). For the next release we'll be focusing mainly on rebranding and code refactoring. We hope you'll enjoy this release as much as we did working on it.

## 0.1.4.1 released!

We released earlier to fix some mako issues while saving PostProcessor and Notification settings.

<br />

####2016-08-30####

## 0.1.4 released!

Another release with a lot of fixes and some new features. The most noticeable change in this release is the improved 'Recommended Shows' page, which now features three options to add your favorite shows: IMDB's popular shows, Trakt lists and for the anime watchers among us, the brand new Anidb's hot anime list. This release consists mainly of under-the-hood changes, as always check out the changelog for more information. We hope you enjoy our efforts!

<br />

####2016-08-03####

## 0.1.3 is finally here!

After nearly a month of hard work, the Medusa team is proud to bring you the biggest release to date, featuring many new features, bug fixes and improvements. The highlight of this release is without doubt the significant improvement made to the name parser. Thanks to [guessit](https://github.com/guessit-io/guessit) we now have a more accurate release name detection and a much more efficient proper detection. Show pages are now enriched with beautiful posters and contain more information about the amount of episodes present for each season, including their total size. Many providers have been fixed, some were added and a bunch were improved. Please have a look at the full changelog for more detailed information. We would like to thank everyone for the amazing support in the past few months and wish all of you relaxing summer holidays!

## Welcome to **Medusa**!

We have worked really hard to bring you many improvement to our fork of SickRage/SickBeard.

First and foremost, we've added a new manual search so you can select the search result you want (Voted **the most desired feature** by SickRage users!) 

In addition, detection of release qualities has been greatly improved by adding additional tags and improving detection of previous tags.

Subtitle searches now work better than ever with the new refiners which ensure higher quality matches, even if the file has already been renamed and added to your library.

Also, don't forget to check out our new Preferred and Undesired word lists which complement the existing Required and Ignored lists!
